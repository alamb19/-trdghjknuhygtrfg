<p class="p1">"YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. The service was created by three former PayPal employees—Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—in February 2005. Google bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion; YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries." As wikipedia states YouTube is for sharing and exploring videos. YouTube is very confusing now. The range of videos is large and goes from childrens toy unboxings to official music videos.
